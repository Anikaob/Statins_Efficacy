**1. Lucia:** <br>
${{\color{Goldenrod}{\textsf{Who:}}}}$ Lucia is a first-year graduate student studying the microbiome and cancer outcomes.<br>
${{\color{OliveDrab}{\textsf{Wants:}}}}$ She wants to use this tool to feed in gut metagenomic data from cancer studies to see if there is an association between diet and responder phenotypes.<br>
${{\color{CornflowerBlue}{\textsf{Needs:}}}}$ She needs the tool to be flexible enough to account for different cancer types and treatments.<br>
${{\color{MediumPurple}{\textsf{Skill:}}}}$  She's new to coding and would appreciate good documentation!

**2. April:** <br>
${{\color{Goldenrod}{\textsf{Who:}}}}$ April is a medical student who is interested in endocrinology and T2DM.<br>
${{\color{OliveDrab}{\textsf{Wants:}}}}$ She wants to use this tool to see if there are specific foods that boost the efficacy of blood sugar lowering medication like metformin. <br>
${{\color{CornflowerBlue}{\textsf{Needs:}}}}$ April needs the tool to allow her to select which medication/outcome combination to optimize. <br>
${{\color{MediumPurple}{\textsf{Skill:}}}}$ April has never worked with multiomic data before. She's taken a basic computer science/Python course. 

**3. Oscar:** <br>
${{\color{Goldenrod}{\textsf{Who:}}}}$ Oscar is a pharmacology student interested in the interplay between diet, medications, and the microbiome.<br>
${{\color{OliveDrab}{\textsf{Wants:}}}}$  He wonders if the tool can help answer which medications are the most influenced by diet.<br>
${{\color{CornflowerBlue}{\textsf{Needs:}}}}$ Oscar thinks it would be cool for the tool to output 'med' plots that show different foods on the x-axis and a marker for efficacy on the y-axis.<br>
${{\color{MediumPurple}{\textsf{Skill:}}}}$ Oscar is a beginner in Python. He is comfortable with making plots in seaborn, but is new to making functions and classes. 

**4. Joey:** <br>
${{\color{Goldenrod}{\textsf{Who:}}}}$ Joey is a 40-year-old patient with pre-diabetes that is currently on statins.<br>
${{\color{OliveDrab}{\textsf{Wants:}}}}$ He is interested in feeding in his own stool metagenomic data to understand how his diet may be interacting with his medication. He also has a history of heart problems in his family and hopes to avoid heart problems.<br>
${{\color{CornflowerBlue}{\textsf{Needs:}}}}$ He is interested in seeing some visualization of his diet and microbiome given metagenomic from his stool sample.<br>
${{\color{MediumPurple}{\textsf{Skill:}}}}$ Joey is familiar with Python but wants an easy user interface.

**5. Riley:** <br>
${{\color{Goldenrod}{\textsf{Who:}}}}$ Riley is a local neighborhood grocer, but as an active community member, they know that the incidence and prevalence of metabolic syndrome is high in their community.<br>
${{\color{OliveDrab}{\textsf{Wants:}}}}$ They recently heard about a cool tool that investigates diet, microbiome, and statin use. They would like to learn which foods are beneficial for statin (or other medication) efficacy, so they could keep prices low.<br>
${{\color{CornflowerBlue}{\textsf{Needs:}}}}$ They would like the tool to display the most commonly used foods for a given community and which of those foods help with measures of medication efficacy.<br>
${{\color{MediumPurple}{\textsf{Skill:}}}}$ They are familiar with the microbiome as they enjoy reading science articles. They also know enough about Python to get started but does not need any indepth prediction or machine learning. 

## Mia's Users:
**1. Mary:** <br>
${{\color{Goldenrod}{\textsf{Who:}}}}$ Mary is a dietician who works with a lot of heart disease patients. <br>
${{\color{OliveDrab}{\textsf{Wants:}}}}$ She wants to better design each patient's diet to complement the statins that they are prescribed. <br>
${{\color{CornflowerBlue}{\textsf{Needs:}}}}$ She wants a point and click GUI that she can use that will tell her what foods have a positive effect on statin efficacy, and which have a negative effect.  <br>
${{\color{MediumPurple}{\textsf{Skill:}}}}$ She is older and has no coding experience, and has to go to her granddaughter to teach her how to use “the google”, but she has years of experience as a dietician, so the GUI must be friendly, but the diet information can be extremely detailed.

**2. Mary:** <br>
${{\color{Goldenrod}{\textsf{Who:}}}}$ Mary the dietician again. <br>
${{\color{OliveDrab}{\textsf{Wants:}}}}$ She likes the idea of using this tool for more patients than just heart disease patients, and wants it to be generalized so that she can design her patient’s diet based on other medication that they are taking. <br>
${{\color{CornflowerBlue}{\textsf{Needs:}}}}$ She wants the same thing as before, just with the ability to switch out what medications the patients are taking with just the press of a button. <br>
${{\color{MediumPurple}{\textsf{Skill:}}}}$ She still is incompetent with computers.

**3. Bradley:** <br>
${{\color{Goldenrod}{\textsf{Who:}}}}$ Bradley is a postdoc in a lab that does patient-centric research on statin usage. <br>
${{\color{OliveDrab}{\textsf{Wants:}}}}$ He has some stool samples from patients who have been prescribed statins alongside a specific diet, and some who are taking statins but have made no change to their diet (not a huge sample size), and he wants to use this tool to find out if the diet change made any difference. <br>
${{\color{CornflowerBlue}{\textsf{Needs:}}}}$ He wants to really be able to see the inner workings of the tool, and he wants to know in depth what elements of the diet are beneficial and what are not. <br>
${{\color{MediumPurple}{\textsf{Skill:}}}}$ He has some coding experience (he uses R regularly and took a class that used Python years ago in undergrad), but he doesn’t want to have to worry too much about the code. <br>


**4. Mary:** <br>
${{\color{Goldenrod}{\textsf{Who:}}}}$ Back to Mary the dietician. <br>
${{\color{OliveDrab}{\textsf{Wants:}}}}$ One of her patients who has heart disease insists on eating pretty much only blueberries, blue gatorade, and scrambled eggs that are dyed blue with food coloring. She is trying to creatively find some more blue foods for her patient to eat to diversify his diet. <br>
${{\color{CornflowerBlue}{\textsf{Needs:}}}}$ She first wants to double check that these foods won’t impact the efficacy of the statins that he is taking. She is so exasperated and worn out by this patient that she just wants to check the foods quickly and easily. <br>
${{\color{MediumPurple}{\textsf{Skill:}}}}$ She still is afraid of computers and really doesn’t want to call her granddaughter for help (using her flip phone). <br>

**5. Drew:** <br>
${{\color{Goldenrod}{\textsf{Who:}}}}$ Drew is a PhD student who works with Bradley, but on a different project. <br>
${{\color{OliveDrab}{\textsf{Wants:}}}}$ He wants to know if he can use the tool to figure out if patients are really eating what they say they are and taking their meds as consistently as they say they are, because he wants to know if the complexity of the prescribed meds and diet routine is too high (and if they would get better patient compliance if it were scaled back). <br>
${{\color{CornflowerBlue}{\textsf{Needs:}}}}$  He wants to compare the data he has from user responses to the output of the tool (when used on their stool samples), and then use the tool to make a priority list of what foods are most important to eat and avoid so that he can scale back the instructions given to the patients if needed. <br>
${{\color{MediumPurple}{\textsf{Skill:}}}}$ He is good at coding, and would prefer to have access to the code itself instead of it all being under the hood of a GUI, but he also doesn’t want to focus too much of his energy on the tool so that he can focus on the patient side of things.

${{\color{MediumPurple}{\textsf{Skill:}}}}$ Kelly is familiar with the microbiome and reading some metagenomic data, but doesn’t have any familiarity with computer science. <br>

**5. Cooper:** <br>
${{\color{Goldenrod}{\textsf{Who:}}}}$ Cooper is a retired microbiome scientist who is interested in keeping up with the latest research. <br>
${{\color{OliveDrab}{\textsf{Wants:}}}}$ Cooper would be able to download datasets from other papers and feed them into this tool. He wants to be able to play around and visualize data to find interesting things he can suggest his former students to look into. <br>
${{\color{CornflowerBlue}{\textsf{Needs:}}}}$ Cooper needs an easy interface with a lot of functionality so that he can play around with a lot of different variables without having to code himself. <br>
${{\color{MediumPurple}{\textsf{Skill:}}}}$ Cooper used to do a little bit of python coding, but not enough for him to do what he wants to do with this tool on his own. <br>
