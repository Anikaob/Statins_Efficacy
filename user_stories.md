## Crystal's Users:
**1. Lucia:** <br>
<font color="Goldenrod">**Who:**</font> Lucia is a first-year graduate student studying the microbiome and cancer outcomes.<br>
<font color="OliveDrab">**Wants:**</font> She wants to use this tool to feed in gut metagenomic data from cancer studies to see if there is an association between diet and responder phenotypes.<br>
<font color="CornflowerBlue">**Needs:**</font> She needs the tool to be flexible enough to account for different cancer types and treatments.<br>
<font color="MediumPurple">**Skill Level:**</font> She's new to coding and would appreciate good documentation!

**2. April:** <br>
<font color="Goldenrod">**Who:**</font> April is a medical student who is interested in endocrinology and T2DM.<br>
<font color="OliveDrab">**Wants:**</font> She wants to use this tool to see if there are specific foods that boost the efficacy of blood sugar lowering medication like metformin.<br>
<font color="CornflowerBlue">**Needs:**</font>April needs the tool to allow her to select which medication/outcome combination to optimize.<br>
<font color="MediumPurple">**Skill Level:**</font> April has never worked with multiomic data before. She's taken a basic computer science/Python course. 

**3. Oscar:** <br>
<font color="Goldenrod">**Who:**</font> Oscar is a pharmacology student interested in the interplay between diet, medications, and the microbiome.<br>
<font color="OliveDrab">**Wants:**</font> He wonders if the tool can help answer which medications are the most influenced by diet.<br>
<font color="CornflowerBlue">**Needs:**</font>Oscar thinks it would be cool for the tool to output 'med' plots that show different foods on the x-axis and a marker for efficacy on the y-axis.<br>
<font color="MediumPurple">**Skill Level:**</font> Oscar is a beginner in Python. He is comfortable with making plots in seaborn, but is new to making functions and classes. 

**4. Joey:** <br>
<font color="Goldenrod">**Who:**</font> Joey is a 40-year-old patient with pre-diabetes that is currently on statins.<br>
<font color="OliveDrab">**Wants:**</font> He is interested in feeding in his own stool metagenomic data to understand how his diet may be interacting with his medication. He also has a history of heart problems in his family and hopes to avoid heart problems.<br>
<font color="CornflowerBlue">**Needs:**</font> He is interested in seeing some visualization of his diet and microbiome given metagenomic from his stool sample.<br>
<font color="MediumPurple">**Skill Level:**</font> Joey is familiar with Python but wants an easy user interface.

**5. Riley:** <br>
<font color="Goldenrod">**Who:**</font> Riley is a local neighborhood grocer, but as an active community member, they know that the incidence and prevalence of metabolic syndrome is high in their community.<br>
<font color="OliveDrab">**Wants:**</font> They recently heard about a cool tool that investigates diet, microbiome, and statin use. They would like to learn which foods are beneficial for statin (or other medication) efficacy, so they could keep prices low.<br>
<font color="CornflowerBlue">**Needs:**</font> They would like the tool to display the most commonly used foods for a given community and which of those foods help with measures of medication efficacy.<br>
<font color="MediumPurple">**Skill Level:**</font> They are familiar with the microbiome as they enjoy reading science articles. They also know enough about Python to get started but does not need any indepth prediction or machine learning.
